Subject: [PATCH] PCI: Add sysfs attribute for PCI device power state

While most PCI power-states can be queried from user-space via lspci,
this has some limits. Specifically, lspci fails to provide an accurate
value when the device is in D3cold as it has to resume the device before
it can access its power state via the configuration space, leading to it
reporting D0 or another on-state. Thus lspci can, for example, not be
used to diagnose power-consumption issues for devices that can enter
D3cold or to ensure that devices properly enter D3cold at all.

To alleviate this issue, introduce a new sysfs device attribute for the
PCI power state, showing the current power state as seen by the kernel.
