Subject: [PATCH 5/6] PCI: Run platform power transition on initial D0 entry

On some devices and platforms, the initial platform power state is not
in sync with the power state of the PCI device.

pci_enable_device_flags() updates the state of a PCI device by reading
from the the PCI_PM_CTRL register. This may change the stored power
state of the device without running the appropriate platform power
transition.

Due to the stored power-state being changed, the later call to
pci_set_power_state(..., PCI_D0) in do_pci_enable_device() can evaluate
to a no-op if the stored state has been changed to D0 via that. This
will then prevent the appropriate platform power transition to be run,
which can on some devices and platforms lead to platform and PCI power
state being entirely different, i.e. out-of-sync. On ACPI platforms,
this can lead to power resources not being turned on, even though they
are marked as required for D0.

Specifically, on the Microsoft Surface Book 2 and 3, some ACPI power
regions that should be "on" for the D0 state (and others) are
initialized as "off" in ACPI, whereas the PCI device is in D0. As the
state is updated in pci_enable_device_flags() without ensuring that the
platform state is also updated, the power resource will never be
properly turned on. Instead, it lives in a sort of on-but-marked-as-off
zombie-state, which confuses things down the line when attempting to
transition the device into D3cold: As the resource is already marked as
off, it won't be turned off and the device does not fully enter D3cold,
causing increased power consumption during (runtime-)suspend.

By replacing pci_set_power_state() in do_pci_enable_device() with
pci_power_up(), we can force pci_platform_power_transition() to be
called, which will then check if the platform power state needs updating
and appropriate actions need to be taken.
